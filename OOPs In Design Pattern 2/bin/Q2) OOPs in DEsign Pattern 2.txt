2. OOPS in Design Pattern…2
    a. Create a directory named as “Package”; make this directory as
    your current Directory.
    b. Create class In Package
    abstract class Player{ com.player;
    public abstract void play();
    }
    interface Playable{ com.playable;
    public abstract void play();
    }
    c. Create the following Concrete Classes using the information given
    below:
    i. FootBallPlayer is A Player and Playable, present inside
    the package com.player.statelevel; with method(s) kick (),
    corner().
    ii. TennisPlayer is A Player and Playable, present inside the
    package com.player.statelevel; separate own method shot().
    iii. ChessPlayer is A Player and Playable, present inside the
    package com.player.statelevel; separate own method
    moveTheDot().
    iv. CricketPlayer is A Player and Playable and also has A
    Player, present inside the package com.player.statelevel;
    having separate own method(s) batting() and bowling().
    v. If you write play() in CricketPlayer class, then one print
    statement should be there;
    System.out.print(“ WITH A CRICKET BALL”);
    vi. If you write play() in FootBallPlayer class, then one print
    statement should be there;
    System.out.print(“ WITH A FOOT BALL”);
    vi. If you write play() in FootBallPlayer class, then one print
    statement should be there;
    System.out.print(“ WITH A FOOT BALL”);
    vii. If you write play() in TennisPlayer class, then one print
    statement should be there;
    System.out.print(“ WITH A TENNIS BALL”);
    viii. If you write play() in ChessPlayerclass, then one print
    statement should be there;
    System.out.print(“ WITH A CHESS DOT”);
    ix. Create a Separate Class Tester. Inside main method of
    Tester Class call the batting method of CricketPlayer
    Class four times only , and the output should be : -
    OUT PUT :-
    Ganguly is batting WITH A CRICKET BALL
    Ganguly is batting WITH A FOOT BALL
    Ganguly is batting WITH A TENNIS BALL
    Ganguly is batting WITH A CHESS DOT
    x. For the above out put you have to design batting method in
    such a way that, it can accept a ChessPlayer,
    CricketPlayer , TennisPlayer and FootBallPlayer object.
