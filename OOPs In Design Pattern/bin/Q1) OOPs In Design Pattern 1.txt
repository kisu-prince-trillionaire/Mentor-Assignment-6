  a. Implement an interface Flyable having fly() method and
    Quackable is an interface having quack() method.
 b. Create an abstract Class Duck as the (Super class) has a Flyable
    and Quackable , having one constructor defined to accept two
    parameter Flyable and Quackable , and one abstract method
    swim().
 c. Write two static and two non static block
 d. Create Two sub classes of Duck i.e DeckyDuck and MolarDuck,
    each having two static and two non static block and fulfill the
    other requirements to be compile.
 e. Create a separate Class DuckSwimTest, from the main method
    call the swim() method of each class by creating their
    corresponding object and also find out the flow of executing the
    constructor, static and non static block by printing some suitable
    statement.
