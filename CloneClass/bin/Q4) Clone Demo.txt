4. Create Clone of a class
    i. Write a program to create a class ‘CloneDemo’ which
    implements java.lang.Cloneable interface with two instance
    variables of int type having name as number and data.
    ii. Make the instance variable data as transient.
    iii. Override the clone() method of Object class in ‘CloneDemo’
    class .Also override toString() method to print the values of
    instance variables in console.
    iv. Implement main method in which create the object of
    CloneDemo class and assign appropriate values to its
    instance variables.
    v. Now create a cloned object using the overridden clone
    method of ‘CloneDemo’ class.
    vi. Show the contents of both original object and cloned object
    in the console

CloneDemo [number=5, data=7]
The cloned data is 
CloneDemo [number=5, data=7]
CloneDemo [number=15, data=17]
The cloned data is 
CloneDemo [number=15, data=17]
